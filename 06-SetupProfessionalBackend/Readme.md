## Setup the project

- Create a new project folder and initialize node environment by using the following command : `npm init` or `npm init -y`.

- Initialize `git` repository and push it to the remote repository.

- Make a Folder `Public` for our images and other stuff. As we know that git does not track empty folders so we will add `.gitkeep` file inside `Public` folder.

- Add `.gitignore` file and use gitignore generators to generate the .gitignore file.

- Create a file `.env`. And also create a `.env.sample` file for the `.env` reference.

- Create `src` folder where we will keep our all the source code files. And create some files like `app.js`, `constants.js` and `index.js`.

- Update the `package.json` file to use modules and add some `scripts` for the production.

- Install `nodemon` packege as a development dependency by using `npm i nodemon` command.

- Add, commit and push the changes to the remote repository.
